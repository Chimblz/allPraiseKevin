        <p> Welcome to The Followers of Kevanity. This group revolves around a man named Kevin Meany. He is a manifestation of our light, a culmination of our love, and the anthropomorphic essence of all that is tranquil.</p>
								<br><p>As a flag is a symbol of a nation's pride, He is a symbol of all that we hold dear. We are no cult, and we are no religion; rather, we are a group dedicated to the pursuit of happiness and the creation and subsequent achievement of personal goals.</p>
								<br><p> This website/group isn't meant to just be a "let's make Kevin an idol, it'll be funny" sort of deal. Sure, it started out like that. But when people started coming together and when we started seeing the positive vibe to it all, we noticed it could be more. We just really want people to be happy here, and if you come across a funny photoshop of Kevin or a goofy post someone makes and it makes you smile and laugh a little, then we did what we wanted to do.

    <h1><strong>Future Intentions</strong></h1>
    <p id="future"> For the time being, this website serves more of an informational page on Kevanity, along side some pictures of Kevin and contact information for The Council. As I continue to learn more development, I will expand on this website. I want somewhere people can come together and do anything. Ask for help on homework, meet new like-minded people, offer advice on a situation, anything. I sort of want my own social network, but with a completely positive and progressive atmosphere.  </p>
