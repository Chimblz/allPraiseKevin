        <h2> <strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/JurdSqurd">Book of England</a></strong><strong></strong> </h2>
            <p>The world is full of sadness and despair. However, the problem is not
that people have nothing to look forward to. The problem is that people are
only looking forward in time, and not appreciating what they have at the
moment. People are so focused on what's going to happen in the long run and
what's going to happen when their time here on Earth is up that they are not
living a happy and full life. Kevanity has shown me the errors of this mindset.
Kevanity has shown me that you need to love everything and be happy with what
is going on NOW. Because we live in a world of uncertainty, a world that can
be destroyed much quicker than it was created. A world where you do not know
what comes next. All you know for fact is the things that are happening around
you. You do not need to worry about what life you have after this one because
you already know the difference between right and wrong and if you live this
life to the best of your abilities then you are already starting whatever life
you have after this one on the right foot. We may all be Followers of Kevanity
but you will always have the choice on what you want to do. Kevin cannot make
these choices for you. And if you have the choice to be happy, why would you
not always be happy? I leave you all with this. Look to Kevin not to solve
your problems. Look not to Kevin to guide you into some sort of better life
after this one. Look to Kevin only to see that it is not as difficult as you
might think to appreciate what you have here and now. The choice is yours,
Kevinites. Shall you join Kevin in living in the present? Or will you spend
this only guaranteed life waiting for the next one that is only hoped for?</p>

    <h2><strong> Book of Ginge</strong></h2>              <!--- After each name, give twitter handle--->
    <p><strong> Chapter 1, Verse 1 </strong><br> And lo the people did cry out for forgiveness, and hearing the cries of the
people and watching their tears, Kevin let out thine holy words: "Fear not,
for the people shall be delivered. Let the men be rested from their labor, and
the children from their schooling, and the women from their oppression. All
who follow me will be freed of evil and of all bad things, and all shall be
allowed to drink the milk of the rabbit." Ye, we worship the father, Kevin. <hr>
    <strong> Chapter 1, Verse 2:</strong> <br> And Kevin so called forth his people to love one another and the world of his
beauty, the nature he hath given us all within our Earth, which he doth also
created. And the Nay-Sayers spoke out against the word of Kevin, which angered
his loyal disciples. But Kevin, the Mightiest of Mights, the One Truth, the
Absolute Being, the Celestial Lord, the Savior of All In Need of Saving, as
well as the Savior All Who Do Not Know They Are In Need of Saving, spoke His
word, and said: "Breath in through your mouths and out. Take not your breaths<hr>
    <strong>Chapter 1, Verse 3: </strong> <br>
        The people praised and worshipped Kevin, giving him glory and bringing grace
to his name, and Kevin was pleased. And in his pleasure he did reward His
people, blessing them with goat cheese and tropical island cruises. And the
followers of Kevin loved His creations, and doth drank the pi√±a coladas, and
did bathe in pineapple juice, and did snack on mango skins, and Kevin, being
the Universal Creation Beast Master of the Universe, farted, and was pleased. <br>
through your bottoms, for that is only for the outward air."
And Kevin so took his deep breath through his holy mouth, and in one blow, the
Nay-Sayers felt the outward air of his holy bottom, and their mouths were
closed.<hr>

    <p><strong>Chapter 1, Verse 1: </strong><br> Some men ask is there life after death Ozzy Osborne asked is there life after
birth. I ask is life anything besides projecting our minds upon a blank
reality that only exists because moody wills it to be. Here's a question I
wonder how much different the world would be today if the roman emperor
Constantine didn't make Christianity the religion of the empire. He brought an
obscure Middle Eastern born religion into Europe where cultures had their own
religions of earth and nature and elemental spirits. For example, the people
of Gaul (France) had a very rich religion according to Caesars book
Commentarii de Bello Gallico. Let alone how the course of history changed just
because of Christian wars and Christian ideas about what was blasphemous
research in the sciences and mind sciences. I leave you with this be a soul
rebel look into all religions all philosophies and pick and choose what you
like there is so much wisdom in each tradition from the jains of India to
druids of the Celtic isles the mystical traditions of Christianity Judaism and
Islam which are rosicursion the qabalistic teachings and the Sufis. to west
African voodun and ancestor worship to the religions of the native Indians of
North and South America to the religions of old the Greek and Roman pantheons
the orphism the tao te ching, the story and path of Buddha (not the actual
temple Buddhists because I think they have become as cut off from the world as
Buddha was as a child) the great philosophers Socrates, Plato Aristotle and
all the rest. Free your mind with all the knowledge and wisdom you can. <hr>
